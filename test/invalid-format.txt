*assembly-scan* reads an assembly in FASTA format and outputs summary statistics in JSON format.

# assembly-scan
I wanted a quick method to output simple summary statistics of an input assembly in JSON format. There are alternatives including [assemblathon-stats.pl](https://github.com/ucdavis-bioinformatics/assemblathon2-analysis) and [assembly-stats](https://github.com/sanger-pathogens/assembly-stats), but they didn't ouput JSON which I wanted. There are examples below on which stats are output below.
